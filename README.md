## Basic instructions
Reach the "goal" from the "start" by teaching the computer your language. Type a command, use ↓ and ↑ to select the right answer, then use ✓ to express your approval.
You can play a lot faster if you use the hotkeys listed on the right side panel.

In the beginning, the computer knows nothing about language, has no built-in vocabulary, and it does not matter what language you want to teach, as long as you are consistent. However, we do assume that ``words" are separated by space, and you might want to put in appropriate spaces.

If you have trouble making progress, consider approving some actions that are similar to the ones you want, or better yet, by being vague. i.e. "put * on stacks with brown and red".
